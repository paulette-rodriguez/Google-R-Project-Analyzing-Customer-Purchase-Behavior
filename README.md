# Google R Project: Analyzing Customer Purchase Behavior
## Business Problem:
For this project, we will be working with the retail data set. This data set represents a
series of customer transactions for a retail business across different product categories
such as Beauty, Clothing, and Electronics.
As data analysts, we are tasked with identifying key trends in customer purchasing
behavior that can help the company improve marketing strategies, optimize pricing, and
enhance customer targeting.

Our objective for this project is to be able to explore patterns in customer purchases to
understand and answer the following questions:
• Which products or product categories generate the most revenue?
• What are the purchasing patterns by gender and age group?
• Are there any seasonal trends in purchasing behavior?
• What is the average purchase value for different customer segments?
• Can we predict potential future trends based on the available data?

## Objective
Our objective is to perform a basic data analysis on the retail data set to answer the
questions listed above. With the use of R, we will import the data, clean the data and
visualize the data to help us uncover insights that can help the business make informed
decisions.
